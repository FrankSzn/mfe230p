# Accessing the Course Public Github

Due to technical difficulties in maintaining a private repository, we will temporarily allow the public access to the repository. You may access the repository at the `https://github.com/mustafaseisa/mfe230p.git`. Specifically, to clone the repository from scratch, execute

```
git clone https://github.com/mustafaseisa/mfe230p.git
```

in terminal. This will copy the repository to your present working directory. Whenever there are updates, you can obtain them by first navigating to the root level of the `mfe230p` repository you have locally and then executing `git pull`. For example, suppose that the `mfe230p` repository is located at `~/Desktop/mfe230p`. Then, I can pull the updates from the master repostory (such as the latest lecture slides) via

```
cd ~/Desktop/mfe230p
git pull
```
